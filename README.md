# AMSOAAT
AMSOAAT is a MATLAB-based application designed for performing two types of multi-objective optimization techniques: multi-objective-multi-functions optimization (MOMFO) and multi-objective-single-function optimization (MOSFO). The application incorporates six optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Pattern Search, NSGA-II, Pareto Search, and SPEA-II. AMSOAAT is specifically developed to assist in the evaluation and design of shading systems, providing a powerful tool for improving daylighting and energy efficiency. Additionally, it is versatile and can be easily applied to similar optimization problems in the field of building design.
